# Trello-like Project
This is a Trello-like project management tool that allows users to organize and manage tasks in three different sections: Pending, In Progress, and Completed. The project features a drag-and-drop functionality to easily move tasks between sections, as well as the ability to add, edit, and delete tasks.

## Features
**Three Work Sections:**

1. **Pending Work:** 
 * Tasks that have yet to start.
 * In Progress Work: Tasks that are currently being worked on.
 * Completed Work: Tasks that have been finished.

2. **Add Tasks:**
 * Each section has a button that allows the user to add a new task to the list.

3. **Edit and Delete Tasks:**
 * Tasks can be easily edited or deleted after being added to the list.

4. **Drag and Drop Functionality:**
 * You can move tasks between sections by dragging and dropping them. No need to delete a task to change its status â€“ simply drag it from one section to another.

## How to Use
**Adding a Task:**

1. *Click the "Add Task" button in any of the three sections.*
     * Enter the task details and click "Add" to save it.
2. *Editing a Task:*
   * To edit a task, simply click on the task name and make the necessary changes.
   * After editing, save the changes to update the task.
3. *Deleting a Task:*
   * To delete a task, click the delete icon next to the task. The task will be permanently removed.
4. *Dragging and Dropping:*
   * To change the status of a task, simply drag it from one section and drop it into another. For example, drag a task from Pending Work to In Progress Work to indicate it is being worked on.
